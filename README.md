# ISEC - Knowledge and Reasoning (CR) - Geometric Shape Classification (2024/2025)

## Context

This repository contains the project materials developed for the practical assignment of the **Knowledge and Reasoning (CR)** course unit, part of the Computer Engineering degree at the Coimbra Institute of Engineering (ISEC), during the 2024/2025 academic year.

## Project Goal

[cite_start]The primary objective was to explore and apply **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)** in **MATLAB** to automatically classify images of six distinct geometric shapes (circle, kite, parallelogram, square, trapezoid, triangle)[cite: 298, 300, 826].

## Key Aspects Covered

* **Neural Network Architecture:** Testing and comparing various FNN configurations, including different topologies (layers/neurons), activation functions, and training algorithms (e.g., trainlm, trainbfg).
* **Data Processing:** Pr√©-processing of image datasets (start, train, test) through binarization and resizing to 28x28 pixels.
* **Model Robustness:** Extensive analysis of network performance, generalization capabilities, and evaluation against manually drawn, external images.
* **Software Development:** **Development of a complete Graphical Application (MATLAB App Designer)** to facilitate network training, parameter configuration, result visualization, and real-time testing.
* **Functionalities:** Implementation of features for dataset management, custom parameter combinations, execution logging, and matrix confusion visualization.

## Tools and Languages Used

* **Platform:** MATLAB (with Deep Learning Toolbox)
* **Design:** MATLAB App Designer
